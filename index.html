    <p>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skid_Row,_Los_Angeles">Skid Row</a> is a neighborhood located in Downtown Los Angeles, California. 
            The neighborhood is widely known for its high poverty rate and the large population of homeless people. 
            According to census data from 2012 to 2016, the median household income in Skid Row was around $10,000 (for Los Angeles overall it is $62,000), 
            whereas the poverty rate was as high as 82% (18% for Los Angeles). 
            This said, here we examine <u><i>influences of parent income and gender on one's income in this neighborhood</i></u>.
            From this particular perspective, 
            it is expected to understand <u><i>the opprotunity for residents in this neighborhood to achieve better economic performance</i></u>,
            and the contributing factors to it.
            Data are provided by <a href="https://www.opportunityatlas.org/">The Opportunity Atlas</a>.
            This organiation collected data on 20 million Americans from childhood to their mid-30s, 
            which help trace the root of their affluence and poverty today.

<!-- I. INDIVIDUAL INCOME, PARENT INCOME, AND GENDER -->

            </h5>
          <p>
              <strong><u><i>There is a positive relationship between the parent income and the individual income, 
                  and males generally have higher income than females.</i></u></strong>
                  We first made comparison on individual income of those who were born in families 
                  with high parental income (top 25%), middle parental income (25-75%), and low parental income (least 25%).
                  It is found that children from richer families are also more likely to earn higher income after they grow up.
                  Children from relatively poor families, however, have lower individual income, 
                  and therefore it is more difficult to ahieve better economic performance.
                  Meanwhile, in each parental income group, males generally earn more than females, indicating a gender-based income inequality.
                  This should arouse our attention that <strong><u><i>the intergenerational upward mobility in this neighborhood is relatively poor</i></u></strong>, 
                  meaning that children originated from poor families are still likely to remain poor as an adult.
                  In addition, <strong><u><i>females from poor families are provided with even fewer opportunities</i></u></strong>. 
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The plot below  shows the relationship between the individual income (indicated by the area of the circle) and parental income and gender. 
                  Across groups, higher parent income is found to lead to higher individual income. 
                  Within each group, females have poorer economic performance than males.

            </h5>
          <p>
              <strong><u><i>Much like the individual income, one's household income is also positively related to the parent income, 
                  and the gender-based inequality still exists.</i></u></strong> 
                  Here we select household income as another indicator for economic performance, 
                  and the finding is very similar to the results above.
                  It can be seen from the line plot below that higher parental income still contributes to the children's higher household income today, 
                  and male's income appear to be significantly higher than females'. 
                  This reinforces our argument above, but drives us to ask a further question: What may have caused  this inequality in Skid Row?

<!-- III. TEENAGE BIRTH RATE AND PARENT INCOME -->

            </h5>
          <p>
                With an attempt to understand reasons for the income inequality between males and females, 
                we examine data on teenage birth rate for women belonging in different parental-income groups in this neighborhood.
                Here we found that <strong><u><i>women born in relatively poor families have higher teenage birth rate in general.</i></u></strong> 
                Teenage birth might be a potential factor that undermines women's access to opportunities, 
                especially economic ones. 
                The teenage birth rates are respectively 23%, 28%, and 36% for women from high-income, middle-income, and low-income families in Skid Row, 
                which indicates that not only a substantial portion of women in this neighborhood have suffered teenage birth, 
                but the problem gets especially significant for those born in families with lower parent income. 
                This therefore may help explain the women's poorer economic performance, 
                and should be tackled with in future porverty alleviation efforts.

                      </h5>
          <p>
                This work briefly explores intergenerational upward mobility in Skid Row through looking at children 
                born between 1978 and 1983 in this neighborhood. It is found that these children are more likely to have 
                higher income (both individual and household) if they were born in richer families, 
                and males generally have more opportunities to economic achievements than females. 
                One possible reason for this lies in the problem of teenage birth, 
                which may hinder females from access to education or pursuit of career. 
                These findings should arouse our attention that people from poor families have low upward mobility 
                and are hardly able to improve their living conditions, while women are especially vulnerable. 
                Some efforts should be made to provide low-income families with access to education and employment, and 
                reduce the teenage birth rate to ensure women with more opportunities.
